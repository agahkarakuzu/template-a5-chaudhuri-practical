# Analysis plan

In this study, we aimed to better understand the utility of copeptin and NSE as predictive biomarkers for neurological outcomes following HIE.
In a sample of 85 infants, we recorded copeptin and NSE measurements at repeated intervals immediately following HIE.
For those infants surviving after a two-year period, we noted subsequent neurological outcome at follow-up.

In order to understand the relationship between neurological outcome and our two blood-based biomarkers of interest, we conducted a logistic regression using measurement levels from the early post-natal period to predict positive neurological outcomes.

These includes table shells that you plan to fill (in (b)) and figures you would like to see/show (including potential sensitivity analyses).
This will be similar in format to the "Methods" section of a journal article.
The length should be minimum one paragraph to 1 page.
- Analyze your data according to your plan and draft the corresponding "Results" section of your manuscript.
