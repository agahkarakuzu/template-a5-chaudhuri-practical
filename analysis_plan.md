# Analysis plan

In this study, we aimed to better understand the utility of copeptin and NSE as predictive blood-based biomarkers for neurological outcomes following HIE.
In a sample of 85 infants, we recorded copeptin and NSE measurements at repeated intervals immediately following HIE.
For those infants surviving after a two-year period, we noted subsequent neurological outcome at follow-up.

In order to understand the relationship between neurological outcome and our two blood-based biomarkers of interest, we conducted a logistic regression using measurement levels from the early post-natal period to predict positive neurological outcomes.
