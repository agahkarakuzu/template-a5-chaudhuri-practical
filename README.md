# Demonstrating p-hacking with real data
*Paramita Saha Chaudhuri, PhD (paramita.sahachaudhuri@mcgill.ca)*

The data is a slightly altered version of a data from a published article.
In this task, you will first create an analysis plan to answer a scientific question (or two) of interest and analyze the data according to the plan.
In addition, I will encourage you to find out association between long-term neurodevelopmental outcome and any biomarker or other characteristics available in the dataset.
I would suggest you create your own plan before looking at the article so as not to bias your thought process.

## Background
[Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE)](https://www.birthinjuryguide.org/birth-injury/types/hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-hie/) is a type of brain damage that occurs when an infant's brain doesn't receive enough oxygen and blood.
It is a dangerous condition that requires immediate medical intervention.

HIE affects 1.5 out of 1000 newborns in developing countries.
While there are some treatment options&mdash;such as [therapeutic hypothermia](https://www.birthinjuryguide.org/birth-injury/treatment/neonatal-therapeutic-hypothermia/)&mdash;that improve neurological outcomes, at least half of these infants still experience adverse effects in their early childhood.
There is therefore a pressing demand for reliable biomarkers to guide early clinical decisions and to help counsel parents.


## Analysis plan
You and your collaborators are interested in investigating [copeptin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18291667) and [neuron-specific enolase (NSE)](https://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/80913) as two novel biomarkers to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcome after birth asphyxia.
For the present study, there is a primary aim:

> **Aim 1:** Are copeptin and/or NSE associated with favorable neurological outcomes at two years post-HIE?

1. Draft analysis plan for **Aim 1**.
These includes table shells that you plan to fill (in (b)) and figures you would like to see/show (including potential sensitivity analyses).
This will be similar in format to the "Methods" section of a journal article.
The length should be minimum one paragraph to 1 page.
- Analyze your data according to your plan and draft the corresponding "Results" section of your manuscript.
- Find out one (or more) novel association(s) in the dataset.
